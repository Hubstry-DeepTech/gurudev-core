## ✨ Try GuruDev® Now!

Curious to see GuruDev® in action? We've launched an **interactive online environment** where you can test GuruDev® code natively and visualize token analysis in real-time!

This **GuruDev® Interactive Lexer** (powered by our enhanced state machine lexer `ply.lex`) is your chance to explore the first layer of our compiler and see how GuruDev® processes its unique syntax, including:
* Grammatical cases and semantic annotations.
* GuruDev® block structures (`[bloco]`, `¡codigo!`).
* Multilingual code blocks (`¿python?`, `¿javascript?`, `¿rust?`).
