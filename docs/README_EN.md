# The GuruDev® Grammar: Unveiling the Humanized Language

> 🌐 **Language / Idioma**: [Português](README.md%20(Da%20Gramática%20EBNF%20da%20Guruev)) | **English** | [Bilingual Index](../BILINGUAL_INDEX.md)

This document serves as an introduction and guide to understanding the EBNF Grammar of GuruDev®, the ontological and multisemiotic programming language that humanizes technology and connects computational logic to human wisdom.

## 1. Why a Unique Grammar?

GuruDev® emerges from the conviction that programming can be more than a series of logical instructions. Inspired by my decades-long journey through languages (from music to literature, from philosophy to mathematics), GuruDev® proposes a new way of dialoguing with machines, reflecting the complexity and beauty of natural language. Our grammar is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophical framework that aims to overcome technological fragmentation and barriers to entry in programming, integrating diverse forms of knowledge.

## 2. GuruDev® as a Linguistic System: Phrase, Sentence and Discourse of Code

In GuruDev®, the analogy with natural languages goes beyond the concept. It is institutionalized in a **general grammar of computer science**, offering a new lens to understand and research programming languages.

* **The Code Line as a Phrase:** We conceive the smallest structural unit of a GuruDev® program as a "phrase" of code – a kind of molecule endowed with completeness and adapted to combination. A phrase is what can be understood and written "in one breath", with its end punctuated by a semicolon (`;`).
* **The Set of Phrases as a Sentence:** We group code phrases around a central action or command, forming a "sentence". Just like in natural language, the sentence in GuruDev® code expresses a complete idea linked to a functionality. Example: `NOM funcao somar(Int a, Int b) { ... };` would be a sentence that defines the action of adding.
* **Code Blocks as Paragraphs:** Code blocks (delimited by braces `{ }`) act as "paragraphs", grouping sentences that develop a specific idea or functionality (as in `serie { ... }` or `paralelo { ... }`).
* **The Complete Program as a Pragmatic Discourse:** The GuruDev® program in its entirety is a "pragmatic discourse" – a functional narrative where components interact to generate meaning and purpose.

This approach not only enhances the expressiveness and readability of GuruDev®, but also offers a powerful conceptual tool for meta-analysis and research of programming languages in general, from a linguistic and semiotic perspective.

## 3. The Formalization: Our EBNF Grammar

The syntax of GuruDev® is formalized in our **official EBNF Grammar**, detailed in [`GRAMMAR_V1_0_0_ALPHA_EN.md`](GRAMMAR_V1_0_0_ALPHA_EN.md). This technical document serves as the precise specification of how each element of the language is structured, including:

* **Grammatical Cases:** How `VOC`, `NOM`, `ACU`, etc., give explicit semantic roles to code operations.
* **Triple Blocks:** The structure of `[bloco]`, `[sobrescrita]`, `¡codigo!` and `[subescritas]` and their components.
* **Semantic Annotations:** The use of `[nivel=""]`, `[raiz=""]`, `[clave=""]` and `[ont=""]` to contextualize the code.
* **Multilingual Interoperability:** How GuruDev® syntax allows the inclusion and interaction with code from other languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.) in a native and semantic way.

This grammar is in constant alignment with the development of our lexer and parser, ensuring a solid and consistent technical foundation.
