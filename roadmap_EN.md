    * **Basic Infrastructure:** Configuration of **Hubstry GitHub Enterprise organization (`Hubstry-DeepTech`)** with repository best practices (README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, etc.).

* **Phase 1 Completion Milestones:**
    * Semantic processor capable of performing simple analogical and ontological transformations.
    * Functional interoperability with at least one external language demonstrated.
    * Set of clear and functional examples on GitHub (`docs/EXAMPLES/`).
    * Well-organized GitHub repository with initial documentation for collaborators.
    * Validation and support from acceleration programs and major market players (Microsoft, Google, Santander, Artemísia).
